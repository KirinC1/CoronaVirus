    <div class="shelter">
        <p>During this shelter in place, I will be trying to stay as active as I can be, and I will try to stay healthy, despite the danger of COVID-19. I will also try to be as productive as I can be, despite the challenges. I might even try and work on a project like a personal website or try and learn a new programming language to pursue projects that I've always wanted to do.</p>

        <h1>No School?</h1>
        <p>The possiblity of school not starting again in the next few weeks is scary, but very real. This is something that we all need to be prepared for. If we don't go back to school this quarter, and we have to take online classes, I will try to make my house a good workspace environment so I can still learn and work on things like I would in regular in-person classes. But just like I said earlier, I think that I would try and find time for myself to work on a personal project and actually complete it for fun.</p>

        <h1>Is the Coronavirus a Serious Pandemic?</h1>
        <p>I think that this pandemic is definitely NOT being blown out of proportion. I think this because this is something that if we do not try to contain it, it will spread very fast and become way more deadly than we think it is now. I think that we need to keep a serious mindset about it, but, there is no need to panic. I think that there are a lot of people around the world that are panicking way too much. If we keep calm, stay healthy, clean, and try our best not to spread it to others if we possibly have it, then I think that this virus will be beaten quickly.</p>
